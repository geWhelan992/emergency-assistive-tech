        <!-- Why I am doing this project -->
        <section>
            <h2>Why I am doing this project</h2>
            <p>I chose this project because I am profoundly deaf and have personally experined how inaccessible emergency announcements and alarms can be.  Through my own experiences and those of other deaf people, I realised that emergency systems often assume everyone can hear, which can place deaf and hard of hearing people at serious risk.  </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Why It Matters -->
        <section>
            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>Standard alarms and intercoms communicate through sound, leaving deaf individuals vulnerable in emergencies. This project prompts a crucial question: if routine communication is already a barrier, how can a deaf person be alerted when every second counts?</p>
        </section>

        
        <!-- Goal of project -->
        <section>
            <h2>Goal of project</h2>
            <p>The goal of my project was to explore how emergency and communication systems could be made more accessible for deaf people, particularly in public spaces. I also wish to: </p>
            <ul>
                <ol>Increase awareness of what it is like to be deaf.</ol>
                <ol>To highlight gaps in curent legislation.</ol>
                <ol>To explore practical and realistic solutions that could work for deaf people.</ol>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Possible soultions -->

            <h2>Possible soultions </h2>
            <ol>
                <ul>Visual Alerts.</ul>
                    <p>I explored visual alerts system using Micro:bit connected to screens to demonstrate how visual warnings could be delivered clearly and instantly.</p>
               <br>
                <ul>Phone Alerts</ul>
                    <p>I examined existing phone alerts systems; however, while these exist, listening devices often have false positive and the vibrations alerts are not strong and clear enough for deaf users in high stress situation. </p>
               <br>
                    <ul>Fire Alarms + Paging System extention. </ul>
                        <p>I learned that many fire alarms system already have bulit in paging and messaging capabilities.   I am recommending that this is extended to send emergency alerts directly to mobile phones, rather than limiting alerts to pagers, used by staff.  In addition this should be made law by including in IS 3218.   </p>
                <br>
                    <ul>QR Code</ul>
                        <p>Rather than relying on an app continuously listening for alarms, which is restricted by the phone operating systems, I am proposing a more realstic system based on WiFi registion and text alerts. </p>
